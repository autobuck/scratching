# scratching

### scratching allows you to write Scratch programs in Processing.

written by Buck Bailey and Eli Baum, 2014


By now, you are probably an expert in Scratch. But most programming languages are not like Scratch. Instead of dragging in blocks, you type commands.

So instead of

![Scratch example](readme-img/scratch-example.png)

you would write something like

```
function whenGreenFlagClicked() {
    if (mouseDown == true) {
        move(10)
    }
}
```

Just like there are many spoken languages (English, Spanish, Chinese) there are also many programming languages. You have been working in **Scratch**. You may have heard of others. Now, you will learn **Processing**, which is based on **Java**.

We have written some code (called "**scratching**") which will allow to you write Processing programs from your old Scratch programs. Below are some instructions on how to use Processing, as well as a full reference for all of the scratching commands.
